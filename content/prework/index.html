<p>Hello! Welcome to Introduction to R. As we need to run this course online due to COVID-19, there are a few things we’d like you to do before we get started to make things run as smoothly as possible.</p>
<div class="clock">
<p>If possible, please try to complete this checklist <em>before</em> the first session on Monday 07/13/2021. Thank you!</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Make sure you have a <a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom account</a>. We will use the same Zoom link for eac session, and you will receive the link via email and slack.</p></li>
<li><p>Join the <a href="https://genecisdatasc-dya2857.slack.com/">slack workspace</a>. This how we will primarily be communicating with each other, and it is the best place to ask questions outside of session hours. We’ll be using the channel <code>#general</code>. You should have received an email invitation to join the <code>genecis-datascience-training</code> workspace on 07/10/2021 (check your Junk/Spam inbox) – if you haven’t received an invitation, send Mandip an email at <a href="mailto:mandip.mistry@gmail.com">mandip.mistry@gmail.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Join the <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/151169/join?access_code=hjL7oU33148M2opDX3VeJI25DC5LqJZkkbYJuQd5">RStudio Cloud workspace</a>. When you click this link you will be prompted to create a free RStudio Cloud account. Follow the instructions and click “Join space” when prompted. You should find yourself inside a workspace called <code>Intro to DS: Genecis</code>. Please don’t open any of the materials just yet – we’ll go through these together during the sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the <a href="/#code_of_conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you all soon. Hopefully we’ll have you loving R in no time!</p>
<p>-Mandip Mistry</p>
