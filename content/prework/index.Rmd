Hello! Welcome to Introduction to R. As we need to run this course online due to COVID-19, there are a few things we'd like you to do before we get started to make things run as smoothly as possible. 

:::clock
If possible, please try to complete this checklist *before* the first session on Monday 07/13/2021. Thank you!

<br> 

1) Make sure you have a [Zoom account](https://zoom.us). We will use the same Zoom link for eac session, and you will receive the link via email and slack.

2) Join the [slack workspace](https://genecisdatasc-dya2857.slack.com/). This how we will primarily be communicating with each other, and it is the best place to ask questions outside of session hours. We'll be using the channel `#general`. You should have received an email invitation to join the `genecis-datascience-training` workspace on 07/10/2021 (check your Junk/Spam inbox) -- if you haven't received an invitation, send Mandip an email at [mandip.mistry@gmail.com](mailto:mandip.mistry@gmail.com). 

3) Join the [RStudio Cloud workspace](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/151169/join?access_code=hjL7oU33148M2opDX3VeJI25DC5LqJZkkbYJuQd5). When you click this link you will be prompted to create a free RStudio Cloud account. Follow the instructions and click "Join space" when prompted. You should find yourself inside a workspace called `Intro to DS: Genecis`. Please don't open any of the materials just yet -- we'll go through these together during the sessions. 

4) Review the [Code of Conduct](/#code_of_conduct).

Looking forward to seeing you all soon. Hopefully we'll have you loving R in no time!
